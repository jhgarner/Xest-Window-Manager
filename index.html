            <h1 id="what-is-xest">What is Xest?</h1>
<p>Xest is an X11 Window Manager with both tiling and floating support. It is inspired by other projects like i3 and XMonad.</p>
<p>The defining characteristic of Xest is its explicit, tree-like nesting. Xest isn’t unique because it represents layouts and windows like a tree; i3 does that already. What makes Xest unique is the direct control users have over the tree. This increase in control allows you to work with things like nested workspaces.</p>
<h1 id="what-does-this-mean-in-practice">What does this mean in practice?</h1>
<p>Imagine there are two projects you’re working on. One of them is a research paper and the other is some kind of coding project.</p>
<p>For the research paper, maybe you have a workspace designated to finding sources in your web browser and a workspace with LibreOffice open….</p>

<source src="./images/research.mp4">
</video>
<p>For the programming project, you might need a workspace with your browser open with documentation, a workspace with your text editor, and a workspace with a couple of terminals for compiling and testing.</p>

<source src="./images/codeproject.mp4">
</video>
<p>Soon, you’re wondering how to organize the two projects. Do you put the research workspaces before or after the project workspaces? What do you do if you need another workspace for one of them? Is moving between everything easy? Is it easier just to close everything related to one project while you work on the other?</p>
<p>The solution to this problem is nested workspaces. At the top level, you have two workspaces open: one for the research paper and one for programming. Inside of those, you have workspaces for each project. You can now pretend like only one of the projects exists at a time making it easier to work without distractions. You can also make better use of muscle memory. Your web browser can always be on the first workspace no matter what you’re working on.</p>

</video>
<p>There’s a little bit more going on in this video compared to the others. The important part is that you can reuse workspaces with only a couple extra key presses when switching projects. Once you’ve switched projects, everything is muscle memory.</p>
<p>Although desktop environments like Plasma offer nested workspaces built in, Xest offers something more generic with its tree structure. In theory, you can nest workspaces as deep as you want in Xest and you can easily move entire desktops around.</p>
<h1 id="how-stable-is-xest">How stable is Xest?</h1>
<p>I consider Xest stable enough to use daily on both my laptop and desktop.</p>
<p>I try to fix as many bugs as I can, but I can’t hit every possible use case. If Xest crashes, every program you had running will crash as well which could mean losing work. Make sure to save often! Check out the various files with “xest” in the name in your “/tmp/” directory if something goes wrong. All logs get output there.</p>
<h1 id="i-want-to-try-it-out">I want to try it out!</h1>
<p>If you’re using arch, check out the package in the release section of the Github project. You can install it using “pacman -U &lt;path to tar.gz file&gt;” Once you do that, follow the instructions in the user guide.</p>
<p>If you want to run Xest from source, clone https://github.com/jhgarner/Xest-Window-Manager and install nix. The stack build tool should make the binary. For actually creating the menus in your display manager, more work will be needed. Look at the Arch package and try to get the non-binary files into the right places.</p>
